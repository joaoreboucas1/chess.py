chess.py is played using algebraic notation.
upon starting to play, the white player is prompted to type a move in algebraic notation (e.g. d4, exb4, Nf3, a8=Q, o-o-o) and press enter.
after the move, the black player will also be prompted to input a move in algebraic notation and the game goes on.
any player can leave the game at any point by typing 'q' in the prompt (or by the classic control+c).
brief explanation:
    pawn moves - just input the square you want the pawn to move (e.g. b4, e4, d5)
    piece moves - input the name of the piece followed by the destination square (e.g. Qb4, Nf3)
    piece names - rook = R, knight = N, bishop = B, queen = Q, king = K
    pawn captures - input the column of the pawn, followed by x, followed by the capture square (e.g. exd5)
    piece captures - input the name of the piece, followed by x, followed by the capture square (e.g. Bxd5)
    castles - o-o for short castles, o-o-o for long castles
    ambiguous moves - if two pieces can execute a move to the destination square, you need to specify which piece will perform the move.
                      example: assuming the first rank is clear, two rooks on a1 and e1 can move to c1. Rc1 is an ambiguous move.
                      in this case, you must specify the column of the rook that will move to c1: Rac1 or Rec1.
                      rows can also cause ambiguity. two knights on a1 and a3 can both go to c2. the move Nc2 is ambiguous.
                      in this case, you must specify the row of the knight that will move to c2: N1c2 for N3c2.
    checks - in algebraic notation, moves that check the opposing king are usually denoted with a plus sign in the end (e.g. Qb1+).
             the player does not need to insert the plus sign in the end of the move.
